## HNKit

HNKit is a Cocoa framework for interacting with [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com), extracted from the [news:yc](http://newsyc.me) project. It supports both iOS and OS X.

There isn't any documentation yet, but you can look at the [news:yc code](http://github.com/Xuzz/newsyc) for examples or just read the headers. If you have any questions, improvements, or suggestions, please feel free to contact me!
